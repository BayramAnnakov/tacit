# Project Guidelines

> Auto-generated by Tacit from team discussions and code reviews.
> Rules are ordered by confidence within each section.

## Architecture

- Return structured error responses with `error_code` and `message` fields from all API endpoints — inconsistent error formats cause frontend bugs (confidence: 0.92)
- Use `@MainActor` for all SwiftUI view models to ensure UI updates happen on the main thread and prevent threading crashes (confidence: 0.85)

## Code Style

- Prefer `async/await` over Combine publishers for new network calls — the team agreed async/await is more readable for simple network requests (confidence: 0.78)
