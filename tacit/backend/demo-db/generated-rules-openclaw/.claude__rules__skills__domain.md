- Skills platform: Skills load from three locations (workspace wins on name conflict): bundled (shipped with install), managed/local (~/.openclaw/skills), and workspace (&lt;workspace&gt;/skills). Skills can be gated by config/env. ClawHub is a minimal skill registry for automatic skill search and installation when enabled.
