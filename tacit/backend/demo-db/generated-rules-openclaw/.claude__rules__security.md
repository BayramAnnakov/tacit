- Gateway server binds to 127.0.0.1 (loopback) by default for security. Use `--bind lan` and set OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN or OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD for external access.
- Docker containers run as non-root user (node) for security hardening. This prevents container escape via root privileges.
- CI runs secret scanning using detect-secrets. Run `detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline` to check for accidentally committed secrets before pushing.
- Security vulnerability reports must include: Title, Severity Assessment, Impact, Affected Component, Technical Reproduction, Demonstrated Impact, Environment, Remediation Advice - reports without these will be deprioritized
