- Pairing and device trust: All WS clients (operators + nodes) include a device identity on connect. New device IDs require pairing approval; Gateway issues a device token for subsequent connects. Local connects (loopback or gateway host's tailnet address) can be auto-approved. Non-local connects must sign the connect.challenge nonce and require explicit approval.
