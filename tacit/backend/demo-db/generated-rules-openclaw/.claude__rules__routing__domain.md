- Bindings route inbound messages to agents via deterministic most-specific-wins matching: (1) peer match (exact DM/group/channel id), (2) guildId (Discord), (3) teamId (Slack), (4) accountId match for channel, (5) channel-level match, (6) fallback to default agent. Each accountId represents one channel instance (e.g., WhatsApp "personal" vs "biz").
