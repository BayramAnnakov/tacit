- Config validation is strict: OpenClaw only accepts configurations that fully match the schema. Unknown keys, malformed types, or invalid values cause the Gateway to refuse to start. Only diagnostic commands work when validation fails (openclaw doctor, logs, health, status). Run 'openclaw doctor --fix' to apply repairs.
- Config file inclusion with $include: Use $include to organize large configs. Single file replaces the containing object; array of files are deep-merged in order (later wins). Sibling keys merge after includes (override included values). Nested includes supported up to 10 levels deep. Relative paths resolve relative to the including file. Clear errors for missing files, parse errors, and circular includes.
- Config hot reload has three modes: "hybrid" (default, auto-restarts for critical changes), "hot" (safe changes only, logs warning for restart-needed), "restart" (restarts on any change), and "off" (no file watching). Most fields hot-apply without downtime; only gateway.* (port, bind, auth, tailscale, TLS, HTTP) and infrastructure (discovery, canvasHost, plugins) require restart.
