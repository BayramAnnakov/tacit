- Preferred model recommendation: Strongly recommend Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.6 for long-context strength and better prompt-injection resistance. Product supports any model but optimizes for this configuration.
- Product philosophy: OpenClaw is a personal, single-user AI assistant optimized for feeling "local, fast, and always-on." The Gateway is the control plane; the product is the assistant itself. It prioritizes developer experience over raw performance.
