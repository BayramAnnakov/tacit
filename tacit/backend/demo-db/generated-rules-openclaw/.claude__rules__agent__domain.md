- An Agent is a fully scoped brain with its own: workspace (files, AGENTS.md/SOUL.md/USER.md), agentDir for auth profiles and per-agent config, and session store under ~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions. Auth profiles are per-agent and stored in agentDir/auth-profiles.json; credentials are NOT shared across agents.
- Workspace bootstrap files are injected on first session turn: AGENTS.md (operating instructions + memory), SOUL.md (persona/boundaries/tone), TOOLS.md (user tool conventions), BOOTSTRAP.md (one-time first-run ritual, deleted after), IDENTITY.md (agent name/vibe), and USER.md (user profile). Blank files are skipped; missing files get a marker line.
