- Core channel docs: docs/channels/; core channel code: src/telegram, src/discord, src/slack, src/signal, src/imessage, src/web (WhatsApp web), src/channels, src/routing; extension channels: extensions/* (e.g. extensions/msteams, extensions/matrix, extensions/zalo, extensions/zalouser, extensions/voice-call)
- Installers served from https://openclaw.ai/* live in sibling repo ../openclaw.ai (public/install.sh, public/install-cli.sh, public/install.ps1)
- Source code structure: src/ (CLI wiring in src/cli, commands in src/commands, web provider in src/provider-web.ts, infra in src/infra, media pipeline in src/media); tests colocated as *.test.ts; docs in docs/; built output in dist/; plugins/extensions under extensions/*
- macOS gateway runs only as menubar app with no separate LaunchAgent/helper label installed - restart via OpenClaw Mac app or scripts/restart-mac.sh; verify/kill using launchctl print gui/$UID | grep openclaw
- When adding a new connection provider, update every UI surface and docs (macOS app, web UI, mobile if applicable, onboarding/overview docs) and add matching status + configuration forms so provider lists and settings stay in sync
- Pi sessions live under ~/.openclaw/sessions/ by default - the base directory is not configurable
- Web provider stores credentials at ~/.openclaw/credentials/ - rerun openclaw login if logged out
- Always consider all built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs)
