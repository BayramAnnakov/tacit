- Session reset lifecycle: Daily reset defaults to 4:00 AM local time on gateway host. A session is stale when its last update is earlier than the most recent daily reset time. When both daily and idle resets are configured, whichever expires first forces a new session. Commands /new and /reset trigger immediate reset; /new &lt;model&gt; accepts model alias or provider/model format.
- Session transcripts are stored as JSONL at ~/.openclaw/agents/&lt;agentId&gt;/sessions/&lt;SessionId&gt;.jsonl. Telegram forum topics use the pattern &lt;SessionId&gt;-topic-&lt;threadId&gt;.jsonl. OpenClaw does NOT read legacy Pi/Tau session folders.
- Sessions follow dmScope rules: "main" (default, all DMs share one session), "per-peer" (isolate by sender), "per-channel-peer" (isolate by channel+sender, recommended for multi-user), or "per-account-channel-peer" (isolate by account+channel+sender for multi-account inboxes). Direct chats collapse to agent:&lt;agentId&gt;:&lt;mainKey&gt; while groups get agent:&lt;agentId&gt;:&lt;channel&gt;:group:&lt;id&gt;.
