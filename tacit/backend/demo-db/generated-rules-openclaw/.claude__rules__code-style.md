description: Code Style conventions
---

- Use OpenClaw for product/app/docs headings; use openclaw for CLI command, package/binary, paths, and config keys
- Run formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt - execute pnpm check before commits
- Use `oxfmt` for code formatting. Run `oxfmt --check` to verify formatting, or `oxfmt --write` to auto-fix. Format check runs before other checks in CI.
- README (GitHub) must use absolute docs URLs (https://docs.openclaw.ai/...) so links work on GitHub
- Keep files concise - extract helpers instead of creating V2 copies
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic
- Keep files under ~700 LOC (guideline only, not a hard guardrail) - split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability
