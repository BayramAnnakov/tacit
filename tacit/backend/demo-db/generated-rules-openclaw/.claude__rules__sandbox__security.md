- Sandbox modes for multi-user safety: Default tools run on host for the main session. Set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "non-main" to run non-main sessions (groups/channels) inside per-session Docker sandboxes. Sandbox defaults: allowlist bash/process/read/write/edit/sessions_*/; denylist browser/canvas/nodes/cron/discord/gateway. Workspace is default cwd (not a hard sandbox); relative paths resolve inside workspace, absolute paths can reach other locations unless sandboxing is enabled.
