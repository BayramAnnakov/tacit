- DM security by default: dmPolicy defaults to "pairing" where unknown senders receive a pairing code and messages are not processed until approval via 'openclaw pairing approve &lt;channel&gt; &lt;code&gt;'. Public inbound DMs require explicit opt-in with dmPolicy: "open" and allowFrom: ["*"]. Run 'openclaw doctor' to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies.
